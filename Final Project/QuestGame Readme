## Synopsis
The Networking Tutor Game is a program that asks the user a series of multiple choice questions. 
The program will either grant or deduct game points based on whether the answer is correct or not. 
When questions are answered correctly the first time full points are granted. 
If the question is answered incorrectly the correct answer is displayed and no points are granted. 
The questions that are incorrectly answered are put back in the pool of questions for a second attempt. 
If answered correctly on the second attempt a low point value is rewarded. 
If the user answers incorrectly on the second attempt points are deducted.

## Code Example
This Code Example is how the questions and multipule choices are printed:
 for(int i=0; i<wrong1; i++){
            System.out.println(repeat1List[i][0]);
            for(int k=1; k<9; k++){
                //if(k==1){System.out.println();};
                System.out.print(repeat1List[i][k]);
                
You can print i or k to check the values to ensure that you are getting the results you desire.


## Motivation
The motivation behind creating the Networking Tutor Game is to engage people that are interested in learning more about networking. 
It will also be of value to people that may be preparing for the networking certification test as the game with have a variety of questions. 

## Installation

Copy Code from Github and put into Code runner or desired compiler. Save file as .java and run program.

## Tests
You can use the "test line" below to ensure that the question is stored into the new array.

if(!wrong){
                        System.out.println("Incorrect. The correct answer should be:"+repeat1List[i][9]);
                        score=score-5;
                        for(int p=0; p<10; p++){
                            //System.out.println(wrong2);
                        repeat2List[wrong2][p]=repeat1List[i][p];
                             //System.out.print(repeat2List[wrong2][p]); //test line
                        
                        }
